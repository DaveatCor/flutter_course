2. Understanding Animation
+Animation:
- Records the current 'value' of the property being animated 
- Record the status of the animation (currently running, stopped, etc)
- status: 'Stopped', yPostion: 110px.

+AnimationController
- Starts, stops, restarts the animation.
- Records the duration of the animation.
- Duration: 1second, stat(), stop().

+Tween
- Decribes the range that the value being animated spans.
- start with a value of 0px end with a value of 200px.

+AnimatedBuilder
- Takes an animation and a 'builder' function.
- Every time the animation thicks (changes value), builder reruns.
